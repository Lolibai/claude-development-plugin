// Self-healing loop specs.
//
// onboard materializes loops/*.md into a project and used to never touch them again — the project
// owns its specs, because they accumulate real project lessons. The cost was that an upstream fix
// (the leaked issue key in daily-report.md, say) could never reach a project that had already
// onboarded: the bug outlived its own fix, indefinitely and silently.
//
// The fix refreshes a spec only when it hashes to some version this stack has shipped, which proves
// nobody edited it and makes the replacement lossless. The two properties that matter are therefore
// opposites, and both have to hold at once: an untouched stale file MUST be updated, and an edited
// file MUST NOT be — a single wrong call in either direction is either a bug that never dies or a
// user's notes silently deleted.
