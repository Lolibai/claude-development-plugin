#!/usr/bin/env node
// Records the SHA-256 of every version of every loop spec this repo has ever shipped.
//
// onboard materializes loops/*.md into a project once and then never overwrites them — the
// project owns its specs, because they accumulate real project lessons. The cost of that rule
// is that a bug fixed upstream (a leaked issue key, a wrong instruction) never reaches a project
// that already onboarded.
//
// This closes it without risking anyone's edits: if a project's copy hashes to a version we
// once shipped, nobody has touched it, so refreshing it is lossless. If it hashes to anything
// else, it has local edits and is left alone. Distinguishing those two cases is the whole job,
// and it needs history — the current file alone cannot tell "outdated" from "customized".
//
// Regenerate before cutting a release (scripts/release.mjs runs this and refuses to release if
// the result is dirty, so a stale table can't ship):
//   node scripts/gen-spec-hashes.mjs
//
// Pass an output path to write the table elsewhere instead of overwriting the tracked one — used
// by tests/spec-self-heal.test.mjs to check the generator is byte-stable without mutating the repo:
//   node scripts/gen-spec-hashes.mjs /tmp/scratch.json
//
// No external dependencies — Node built-ins only.
