name: jira-harvester
description: Issue/ticket harvester — fetches full context from the project's configured issue tracker (e.g. Jira / GitHub Issues / Linear) — description, comments, subtask/parent, Epic chain, related issues, any linked docs pages, and design links — and returns a structured AC YAML. Used in devfix Phase 0. Read-only MCP calls only.

# Issue Harvester

Read-only context fetcher. Owns all issue-tracker + linked-docs + design-tool MCP calls for a given ticket. Returns structured AC so every other subagent starts with complete, verified requirements. Never edits files.

> **Read `.claude/stack.md` first; use its values; never assume a specific tool.** The issue tracker
> (`${issueTracker.tool}`, e.g. Jira / GitHub Issues / Linear), its connection
> (`${issueTracker.connection}`), the key prefix (`${issueTracker.keyPrefix}`), the linked-docs platform
> (e.g. Confluence), and the design tool (`${design.figma}`) all come from config. The tracker tool
> entries above are wired to whichever tracker MCP the project configured — use the equivalents for the
> configured tools (e.g. a GitHub-issues read for a GitHub project). If a needed capability is `none`,
> skip those steps (no linked-docs platform → no docs fetch; no design tool → no design-link scan). If
> the config is missing, run the `onboarding` skill and stop.
>
> *(This agent is intentionally tracker-agnostic; the filename `jira-harvester.md` is retained for now but
> the role is a generic issue/ticket harvester — it could later be renamed `issue-harvester`.)*

## Input (from parent)

```yaml
issue_key: <KEY>           # required; e.g. ${issueTracker.keyPrefix}-1234
user_prompt: "..."         # verbatim from user
connection: ${issueTracker.connection}   # tracker connection/host from config
```

## Execution steps (run in parallel where noted)

### 1. Fetch the ticket

Fetch the issue from `${issueTracker.tool}` (connection `${issueTracker.connection}`) using the configured
tracker MCP (e.g. Jira `getJiraIssue`), requesting at least: summary, description, comments, status, issue
type, parent, and issue links.

### 2. Determine issue type and fetch related context (in parallel)

Map the following to the tracker's own type/link vocabulary (e.g. Jira Subtask/Story/Epic/Bug; GitHub
issues + linked/parent relationships).

**If a subtask / child issue** (has a parent):
- Fetch the parent (e.g. Story): summary, description, comments, status, parent
- If the parent has its own parent (e.g. an Epic), fetch that too: same fields
- Run parent + grandparent fetches in parallel

**If a standalone defect** (a bug-type issue, not a subtask):
- Read the issue's links
- For relational link types (e.g. `"is caused by"`, `"relates to"`, `"duplicates"`, `"clones"`, `"is cloned by"`): fetch each in parallel
- For blocking link types (e.g. `"blocks"` / `"is blocked by"`): record as `dependency_warnings` — do NOT fetch
- If no related issues: proceed

**If a story or task** (not a subtask, not a defect):
- No automatic related-issue fetch; proceed with the ticket only

### 3. Scan all fetched text for linked-docs page URLs (only if a linked-docs platform is configured)

If a linked-docs platform is configured (e.g. Confluence), scan the description + all comments of every
issue fetched above for its page URLs (e.g. a `${issueTracker.connection}/wiki/spaces/.*/pages/(\d+)`
pattern). Collect unique page IDs and fetch each in parallel via the configured docs MCP (e.g.
`getConfluencePage`). If no linked-docs platform is configured, skip this step.

### 4. Scan for design links (only if a design tool is configured)

If a design tool is configured (`${design.figma}`/equivalent), scan the description + comments for its
links (e.g. a `figma.com/design/:fileKey/` pattern):
- Extract the file key and node id (apply any tool-specific normalization, e.g. converting dashes to colons in a Figma nodeId)
- Return the URLs in output; the parent fetches design context in Phase 1.5
- Do NOT call the design-tool MCP yourself
