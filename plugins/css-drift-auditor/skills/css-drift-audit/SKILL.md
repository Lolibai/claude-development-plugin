description: >
  Systematically audit and normalize CSS/design drift across any frontend
  codebase using Storybook-rendered computed styles. Use when the user wants to
  find inconsistent colors, spacing, typography, or radii; make a design system
  consistent; extract design tokens from existing components; or run a "design
  drift", "CSS audit", or "style consistency" pass. Framework-agnostic — works on
  React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular through Storybook.

# CSS drift audit

Audit design-value drift by rendering every component in Storybook and reading
post-cascade computed styles — the ground-truth pixel values after Tailwind,
theme providers, CSS variables, and inheritance resolve. Source-level regex
misses these; computed styles do not. Storybook is the universal surface, so the
same pipeline works for any framework it renders.

All scripts live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts` and run with bare `node`
(no project TypeScript required). Run them from the target project root. Drive
the phases in order and stop at each CHECKPOINT for user review.

## Phase 0 — Detect environment
Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-framework.mjs --write`.
It writes `design-audit/framework.json` (framework, Storybook preset, component
dirs, package manager). Read it before continuing.

## Phase 1 — Map the surface + Storybook coverage
1. Copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/audit.config.json` to
   `design-audit/audit.config.json` if absent; let the user tune thresholds.
2. Map the actual element surface — pages are a mix of components AND raw HTML
   tags, and raw tags are where drift hides:
   `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/element-map.mjs`. It auto-dispatches by
   framework via pluggable parsers in `scripts/parsers/` (React `.tsx`/`.jsx`
   and Angular `*.component.ts` ship today; Vue/Svelte are drop-in additions).
   Deps are resolved from the target project: React needs `@babel/parser`,
   Angular needs `@babel/parser` + `parse5`
   (`npm i -D @babel/parser parse5`). Writes `element-map.json` with a per-file
   html+component tree and a `styledHtmlTags` list — raw HTML elements carrying
   className/inline-style/Tailwind-arbitrary values. This is the source-level
   drift surface.
3. If `framework.json.hasStorybook` is false, tell the user Storybook is
   required and offer `npx storybook@latest init`. Do not install without
   confirmation.
4. Catalog components and find coverage gaps:
   `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/project-map.mjs` then
   `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate-stories.mjs` (dry run).
   Review the list with the user, then re-run with `--write`. Auto-generated
   stories carry a header marker and may fail to render if the component needs
   required props — that is expected; refine those few by hand.

## Phase 2 — Extract computed styles (the core)
1. Start Storybook: `npm run storybook` (background), or build static with
   `npm run build-storybook` and pass `--static storybook-static`.
2. Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extract-computed-styles.mjs`
   (needs Playwright: `npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium`).
3. Output: `design-audit/computed-tokens.json` — every distinct computed value
   per property, with usage counts and owning components.

CHECKPOINT: surface the per-property distinct-value counts before analysis.

## Phase 3 — Analyze drift
Run `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/analyze-drift.mjs`. Outputs
`design-audit/drift-report.md` (clusters, canonical per cluster, low-usage
outliers flagged) and `design-audit/suggested-tokens.json`
(drift value → canonical → token name).

There are two complementary drift surfaces — cross-reference both: the runtime
surface (`computed-tokens.json`, what the cascade actually produced) and the
source surface (`element-map.json` → `styledHtmlTags` / `arbitrary`, the raw
HTML tags and Tailwind arbitrary values authored directly). A value flagged in
both is high-confidence drift; a raw tag with an arbitrary value is a prime
candidate to either tokenize or lift into a component.

CHECKPOINT: the user reviews drift-report.md and marks any intentional one-offs
as `"intentional": true` in suggested-tokens.json. Never modify intentional
values.

## Phase 4 — Fix (parallel, scoped)
For each domain (color, spacing, typography), spawn the `drift-fix-agent`
scoped to ONE property family. Each agent replaces only its domain's drift
values with the approved token, never touches component logic or other domains,
and commits per domain. Never auto-merge — each commit needs review.

## Phase 5 — Verify
1. Re-run extract-computed-styles → confirm flagged drift values are gone.
2. Run Storybook's test-runner or a Playwright screenshot diff per story to
   catch visual regressions — per-component, not whole-page.
Report a short coverage + regression summary.

## Guardrails
- Cluster on browser-normalized computed values, never on raw source strings.
- One domain per fix agent. Commit per domain. No auto-merge.
- Values marked `"intentional": true` are immutable.
- Confirm before installing Storybook or Playwright into the user's project.
